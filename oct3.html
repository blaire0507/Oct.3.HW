    <h3> 
Distribution is the display of data at set intervals that may or may not show a pattern. Distribution is how the data is displayed. 
    </h3> 
<p1>    
<br> 
The four elements used to describe distribution are:
<br> 
Level: the measure of central tendency, such as the mean. 
<br> 
Spread: partaining to the data, the spread of the data shown. It is the amount at which the distribution is lengthened on the graph -- or other visual -- or shortened/condenced.
<br> 
Shape: partaining to the data, the shape of the data shown. The amount of peaks, the pattern of peaks and lows created by the data visual, or the overall uniformity. Shapes will have different names that are associated with different patters on different data visualizations. An example would be a bell shaped histogram where the peak is in the middle and the bars on either sides of the peak are decending. 
<br> 
Outliers: data that does not follow the trends of the other data points or amounts shown for one group of data. Outliers are often very high or very low in proportion to the rest of the data. Outliers can throw off the mean, median, and mode of a data set.
